*This is the repository for the Mountain Lakes High School robotics team.*

The TeamCode source files we use are located here.

The code in this repository is _not_ for use without the permission of the Mountain Lakes High School robotics team.

### Note when downloading the files included:
You cannot compile this into a built app on its own. It requires the FTC app and must be inserted into it.
Keeping our own custom code seperate helps keep the size down.
